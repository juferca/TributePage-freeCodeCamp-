        <p>Quin began training as a professional wrestler in June 2002. Initially working in Ireland, and occasionally teaming with her brother using the ring name Rebecca Knox, she soon expanded her career into the rest of Europe and North America
          on the independent circuit, wrestling regularly for various promotions. She most notably competed in Elite Canadian Championship Wrestling and became the inaugural SuperGirls Champion in June 2005.</p>
        <p>In September 2006, Quin suffered a severe head injury during a match which kept her away from professional wrestling for several years. She returned in late 2012 and signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2013,
          reporting to the developmental territory NXT. Following her arrival on WWE's main roster in 2015, she became the inaugural SmackDown Women's Champion at Backlash 2016 and has held the title a total of three times.</p>
        <p>In 2018, Lynch transitioned towards a more aggressive character, which started at SummerSlam when she attacked Charlotte Flair, perceiving herself as an unfairly-treated underdog and dubbing herself "The Man", resulting in a large increase
          in her popularity and fan support. In January 2019, she won the women's Royal Rumble match. At WrestleMania 35, in what was the first time women headlined a WrestleMania event, Lynch won both the Raw Women's Championship and SmackDown
          Women's Championship, making her a double champion and the only woman to hold both titles simultaneously. She is now an overall four-time women's champion in WWE.</p>
